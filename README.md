# Fuzzy neural network

## The aim of the project was to create fuzzy neural networks and compare the results with a regular neural network model

## The project used networks based on data from three membership functions:
+ triangular
+ trapezoidal
+ gaussian

## The project also examined several different network structures: 
1. a standard one
2. based on grid search CV 
3. simple one, based on one hidden layer

## The first part of the project shows the general application of fuzzy neural networks (on the make_blobs set) and the creation of a general tool for converting data into fuzzy data

## The second part of theÂ project shows the actual use of fuzzy neural networks on the seattle-weather set 
Each fuzzy neural network is at least 9 percent more accurate than a regular neural network.
